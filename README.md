# gluten_free_flour_optimization
A quick python script I wrote to compute an optimal flour blend to replace bread flour, given the list of alternative flour types at hand

Dependencies: numpy, scipy

This is still in draft form. For now, flour types are hardcoded into the code. Run using:
```
python flour_problem.py
```
